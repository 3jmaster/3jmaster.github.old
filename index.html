  <body>
   Hi, my name is Fabian!
   <p></p>
   What I do:
   <p>Hi, as you can see I am not the best UI designer. I tend to be the backend-kinda guy. ;)</p>
   <p>In the day, I am a full-time, full-stack <a href='https://medium.com/what-about-security/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-dev-sec-ops-engineer-75d549b34d1d'>DevSecOps Engineer</a> for a governemnt Platform-as-a-Service</p>
   <p>Other times, I give talks, workshops, hack, build, and evangelise on the important of security.</p>
   <p>Some of my contributions can be found on DevSecOps.org, DevSecOpsSG, RSA and DevSecCon.</p>
   <p>I blog and tweet (https://medium.com/@3jmaster) occassionally to bring security concepts into human languages for bigger audience to consume - for I believe that human is the weakest link.</p>
